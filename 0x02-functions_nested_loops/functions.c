/* How to Call Functions */
1. By referencing its name, and adding any arguments if any.
1.1 And we tend to do this while assigning it to another variable that is defined inside function main

/*Functions with no type*/
1. Use Void

Unless stated wotherwise;
	- All functions will be given int.

	- Good rule of Thumb; Program Defensivley; Check the arguments
	- Header files be having protptyes functions
